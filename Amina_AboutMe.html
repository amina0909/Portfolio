        <strong><p class="col-sm-16 text-center" style="color:white;">Hi! I'm Amina. I'm a 15 year old sophomore at Dublin High School. I have a younger brother in second grade. My hobbies include Camping, Baking, Traveling, and Photography. I'm really passionate about fashion and love styling outfits and dressing up. I play competetive ping pong. I hope to have a career as a psychologist when I'm older. This is my first year coding, and so far I find it fun! In the future, I hope to have a career as a Psychologist. Specifically as a forensic, criminal, or clinical psychologist. Aside from  that, I would also like to work with young children and toddlers.</p>
  
        <p>I'm a very social person and I love meeting new people and befriending them! I always try to be optimistic and focus on the bright side of life. I'm a loving and caring person and always hopes the best for everyone. I'm also a very good listener, and am always willing to listen and be there for someone in times of hardship. I respect everyone and never judge people, which is why I believe Psychology is my ideal career.</p>

        <p>Some of my major life achievements are winning speech competitions, and being chosen to work with a huge charitable organiation. I have been participating in speech competitions ever since I was a young kid, as I have always felt passionate about public speaking. I like giving speeches on current world affairs, and especially matters that pertain to the youth. I have won a number of speech competitions that I've participated in, and I consider this one of my major accomplishments, as it means that all the time, effort, and hard work I put into public speaking paid off. 
  
        <p>Another one of my achievements, was being chosen to work on an annual charity campaign for Givelight Foundation. When I was ten, my friends and I met with the founder of Givelight and planned a huge craft sale, to raise awareness and money for orphans affected by natural disasters in Indonesia. We have continued this sale every year, and I am one of the organizers of the event. This is a huge achievement for me because I am giving back to my community by making a positive impact for so many orphans. From these experiences I have learned that there is beauty in giving back too, and that no small effort to make the world a better place goes to waste. These opportunities have made me a better person, and continue to motivate me to give back to the world.</p>


        <p>Well, that was just a little bit about myself and what I hold close to my heart! Thank you for taking the time to read about me and feel free to explore the rest of my website!</p></strong>
